This is a clone of Chuck Hills MicrosoftPlugIn (formerly SQLServerPlugIn) I made in 2010.



Enhancements/Hacks:

Support for NVARCHARS and NTEXT:  I had to modify EOJDBCMicrosoftPrototypes.plist and Resources/JDBCInfo.plist to store UTF-8 String _and_ to use migrations + prototypes... 


TODO:

* Update to WO 5.4 EOSchemaGeneration
